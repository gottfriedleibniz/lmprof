** create(...): Create a profiler instance.

** Each userdata instance maintains its own local configuration. In addition,
** for Lua 5.4 this userdata can be configured as to-be-closed to ensure that a
** profiler can never exit a scope without it automatically(*) stopping itself.
**
** (*) to-be-closed conditions apply.

/*
** start: start a profiler instance. Pushing the profiler userdata onto the

**
** This function registers the profiler singleton in the registry and may
** (depending on profiling mode) override (wrap) the active Lua allocator. While
** a profiler is active debug.sethook and lua_setallocf should not be used. Any
** calls to lmprof.start will throw an error.
**
** (*) While a profiler is active debug.sethook and lua_setallocf should not be
**  used. Any calls to lmprof.start will throw an error.
**
** Modes:  The profiling configuration arguments are passed in as strings:
**  "time" - [TIME] The time between successive start/stop operations.
**
**  "instrument" - [GRAPH] Measurements between successive lua_Hook calls and
**      track the relationships between functions.
**
**  "trace" - [TRACE] Generate events compatible with DevTools
**
**  "single_thread" - Single thread profiling. Ignore all threads except the one
**    that invoked 'start'.
**
**  "memory" - Enable memory profiling by hooking the Lua allocator.
**    GRAPH: Track the memory usage between successive lua_Hook calls.
**    TRACE: Generate 'UpdateCounters' Trace Events.
**
**  "sample" - Enable sampling: the Lua interpreter generating events after it
**    executes a fixed number of instructions.
**
**    GRAPH: When "instrument" or "memory" are not enabled, this will dump the
**      thread that generated the LUA_HOOKCOUNT and attempt to build the graph
**      structure from the "leaves" upwards. Note, this will only do "raw"
**      counts.
**
**    TRACE: Only enabled for "single_thread" profiling. Will generate an
**      additional "timeline" of EvaluateScript events that correspond to the
**      duration of the 'sample', i.e., execution of X number of instructions.
**
**  "lines" - Enable line instrumentation: the Lua interpreter generating events
**    whenever it is about to start the execution of a new line of code, or when
**    it jumps back in the code.
**
**    GRAPH: 'Aggregated' activation records are formed by hashing a
**                <function_id, parent_id, parent_line>
**      triple. When the 'line_freq' option is enabled: each aggregated
**      activation will also record a line-execution frequency list (presuming
**      the record is a Lua function).
**
**    TRACE: Generates additional timeline events. Note, this function should
**      never be enabled.

**
** Options:
**  General Options: [BOOL]
**    'micro' - Ensure times are measured on a microsecond scale.
**    'disable_gc' - Disable the Lua garbage collector for the duration of the
**      profile.
**    'gc_count' - Include LUA_GCCOUNT (the amount of memory in use by Lua)
**      information on profiler initialization. Note, this value will not
**      include memory managed by external C libraries that use lua_getallocf.
**    'reinit_clock' - Reinitialize, e.g., QueryPerformanceFrequency, the
**      profiler clock prior to profiling.
**    'mismatch' - allow call stack mismatching, i.e., start/stop not called in
**      same scope.
**    'load_stack' - Populate each profile stack with its traceback on
**      instantiation. Note, this option is closely related to mismatch.
**    'line_freq' - Create a frequency list of line-executions for each profiled
**      Lua function (graph instrumentation; requires "line" mode).
**    'compress_graph' - When enabled a lmprof_Record instance will represent
**      all activations of the same function, i.e., a function can have multiple
**      parent records. Otherwise, each record represents a single function
**      instance, i.e., a single parent/child relationship.
**
**      If the 'lines' mode is enabled, lmprof_Record instances will include
**      line number of the callsite in the parent/child association. This option
**      closely resembles the V8 CpuProfilingMode enumerated type
**    'output_string' - Output a string representation of the formatted output.
**        GRAPH - A Lua table; see '_G.load'
**        TRACEEVENT - A formatted JSON string.
**
**  General Options: [INTEGER]
**    'instructions' - Number of Lua instructions to execute before generating a
**      'sampling' event: LUA_MASKCOUNT.
**    'hash_size' - Default number of buckets in the hash (graph) table (limited
**      to 1031).
**
**  Trace Event Options: [BOOL]
**    'compress' - Suppress Trace Event records with durations less than the
**      provided 'threshold'. Unit of time defined by lmprof_get_timeunit.
**    'ignore_yield' - Ignore all coroutine.yield() records. This option
**      requires the coroutine.yield global definition to exist.
**    'draw_frame' - Enable BeginFrame support for trace events, i.e., each
**      'frame' corresponds to length of a coroutines execution; the time
**      between successive resume/yield calls.
**    'split' - Output a unique thread ids for each thread in the chromium
**      output; Otherwise, all events use the main thread and stack elements are
**      artificially pushed/popped when the coroutine resume/yields.
**    'tracing' - Output a format compatible with chrome://tracing/.
**
**  Trace Event Options: [INTEGER]
**    'process' - Synthetic Trace Event process ID.
**    'counter_freq' - Frequency of 'UpdateCounters' event generation.
**    'page_limit' - TraceEvent buffer size, i.e., maximum pages amount in
**      bytes (zero = infinite)
**    'threshold' - TraceEvent suppression threshold in microseconds, requires
**      'compress' to be enabled.
**
**  Trace Event Options: [STRING]
**    'name' - Synthetic Trace Event 'TracingStartedInBrowser' Name.
**    'url' - Synthetic Trace Event 'TracingStartedInBrowser' URL.
